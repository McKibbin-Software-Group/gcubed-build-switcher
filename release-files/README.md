# RELEASE INSTRUCTIONS

Once you've completed your updates, pushed everything to GitHub, *and confirmed* all required changes are in the GitHub `main` branch:
  * Create a release on the `main` branch
    * Ensure that the release will receive the '`latest`' tag
  * Attach the `toml` and `vsix` files from this directory to the release
    * These are the files that `gcubed-devcontainer-template` downloads on a container build and uses to build up a customer devcontainer
