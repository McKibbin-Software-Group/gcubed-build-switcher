# ONLY set this for testing/troubleshooting or if working on GCubed Code source-code

# NOTE: disables the PYTHON auto-switching when this env variable is _present_.
#       Any value will do
#       EVEN setting it FALSE will disable the auto-switch function.
#       So just comment/uncomment the line!

# NOTE: can also be manually exported/unset in devcontainer terminal, which is probably
#       better for your mental health anyways...

#       you have been warned...
