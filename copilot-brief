We will be talking about the implementation of the JavaScript vscode-extension from this point forwards (that is, the contents of `vscode-extension` and its child directories, especially `src`).

Before answering any questions in this chat, have a look at the files in my #codebase , focussing on files in `vscode-extension/src` and ensure you have a fresh view.

The intent of this extension is to live inside a devcontainer context and listen for and act upon simple requests from a python-based client within that same devcontainer context to change the current VS Code Python Interpreter (ie change active venv).

The extension was initially written to support HTTP connectivity, then we added Unix Sockets, and we have now deprecated and largely removed the HTTP part.

I would like to review and improve the current structure of the extension implementation - but only want to focus on low-hanging fruit.  I want to do what is simple and doesn't require wholesale code rewrite - but only if it enhances understandability or maintainability

 Any & all advice appreciated.
